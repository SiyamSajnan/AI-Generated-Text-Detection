# AI-Generated-Text-Detection
This project aims to detect AI-generated text by leveraging sentence embeddings from a fine-tuned large language model. Using the DAIGT v2 dataset, which contains labeled examples of AI-generated and human-generated text, the study creates a model to predict whether a given text is AI-generated or human-written.
